We do takeaway is a free and open source collection of software projects to
provide a service that allows restaurants to invite customers to view their
menu online, order food and then provide tools to manage the fulfillment of
the order and delivery to the customer.

The original idea for this came about from Covid 19 putting pressure on 
restaurants to stay in business as well as wanting to compare development 
and use of GraphQL on a range of different back-end and front-end frameworks.

Eventually there may be a collection of blog posts and tutorials to go
along with this service to help others build GraphQL applications and
read about any lessons learned.
